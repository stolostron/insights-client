# insights-client

Uses Red Hat Connected Customer Experience (CCX) to provide health check insights for all managed cluster (clusters have to be Openshift versioned >= 4.X). The insights-client will create a Custom Resource (PolicyReport) for each cluster that contains all Insight violations.

## Development

1. Install dependencies
    ```
    make deps
    ```
2. Generate self-signed certificate for development
    ```
    sh setup.sh
    ```
3. Log into your development cluster with `oc login ...`.
    > **Alternative:** set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to some other kubernetes config file.
4. Run the program
    ```
    make run
    ```
